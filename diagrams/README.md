|[class diagram](https://github.com/nxmyxxn/CS151-GroupUp/blob/main/diagrams/151ProjClass%20Diagram.drawio.png)|The class diagram is used to visualize and describe the structure of a system in terms of classes, attributes, operations, and relationships. This is the class diagram of "GroupUp". It includes exception, object oriented, and graphic user interface classes. What is not shown is the model, or the database that holds the data permanently in a different location.
|[use case diagram](https://github.com/nxmyxxn/CS151-GroupUp/blob/main/diagrams/UseCaseDiagram.pdf)|The use case diagram shows the interaction between the system and the actors who use it. This diagram shows the interaction between certain actions and a user, the user's friend, another friend of the user who is also part of a group the user is a part of, and the administrator. Some actors may be able to participate in all or most of the actions, while some actors' actions may be limited.|

There is processingLoginLogout which shows users states such as whether they logged in or not, and MakingSchedule which shows the state of schedule such as adding or deleting. |
|[sequence diagram](https://github.com/nxmyxxn/CS151-GroupUp/blob/main/diagrams/SequenceDiagram.pdf)|The sequence diagram shows the lifespan of the object, from creation to destruction.The user can create an account, where they will be asked to verify their email. The user can log into an account, they can create a schedule. They will be given different options for different schedules and may choose one of those options to customize their schedule. The UI will finally display the user's newly created schedule if the user follows through with creating a schedule.|
